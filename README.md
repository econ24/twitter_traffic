My project for my Spring 2014 CSI 503 Data Mining course at The University at Albany.

Simple Twitter crawler that collects traffic tweets for the Albany, NY, area and classifies them using a SVM.
Also serves the relevant tweets through a REST API derived from Python's base SocketServer class.

The Geolocation code was given to me by my projessor, Feng Chen.
